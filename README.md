# Java Exercises

This repository is a collection of Java exercises I’m solving to practice consistently and improve my programming fundamentals.  
I organize the code mainly by **exercise type/topic**.

## Sources
Some exercises come from:
- Exercism (Java track): https://exercism.org/tracks/java
- Retos de Programación: https://retosdeprogramacion.com/ejercicios/

Solutions are written by me. When I reference an exercise, I link to the source instead of copying full statements.

## Project structure
- `src/` → Java source files grouped by topic:
  - `basics/`
  - `controlflow/`
  - `arrays/`
  - `strings/`
  - `oop/`
  - `collections/`
- `bin/` → compiled `.class` files (generated when I compile/run locally)

## How I run the code
Most files are small exercises. Some may not include a `main` method (they’re meant to be used as part of an exercise).
